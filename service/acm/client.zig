    ///   certificate fields.
    /// * The `Issuer` field must not be empty.
    /// * The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.
    /// * To import a new certificate, omit the `CertificateArn` argument. Include
    ///   this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported
    ///   certificate.
    /// * When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the
    ///   certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file
    ///   names preceded by `fileb://`. For example, you can specify a certificate
    ///   saved in the `C:\temp` folder as

    ///   certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the
    ///   manner required by the programming language you're using.
    /// * The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the
